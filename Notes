Thank you for highlighting this. The delay occurred as my timesheet had to be revised due to a time swap between my standard and shift timings. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.

Going forward, I will ensure timely submission of timesheets on a weekly basis.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
