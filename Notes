Clarification on API Commit Data Visibility

I tested a Git commit locally, but the data did not appear on the API. Even after pushing the commit, the data still didnâ€™t show up on the API. However, once the pull request was approved, the data became visible on the API.

Could you please confirm if this behavior is correct? Alternatively, is there another API where we can view the data?

Looking forward to your response.
